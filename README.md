## Supported data:
- DEM for the western USA with spatial resolution of 1 arc â€“sec and NAD83 geographic coordinates system in Tiff Format
- National Land Cover Dataset 2011 (NLCD 2011) covering the whole USA with Projected coordinates of Albers_Conical_Equal_Area  and resolution of 30 m in Tiff format
- Daymet Climate Data for the whole USA for the following variables for years 2010 and 2011. 
  Data will be stored for more years (2005 to 2009) once the data service functions are completely implemented.
  The spatial resolution is 1 Km with spatial reference system of lambert_conformal_conic and daily temporal 
  resolution in netCDF format.
    - Precipitation (mm/day)
    - Daily maximum temperature (oC)
    - Daily minimum temperature (oC)
    - Vapor pressure (Pa)
    - Solar radiation (W/m^2)
- NLDAS climate data (accessed through web services not stored locally)
